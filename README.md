NOTES
1. Files were named according to the date/activity.
2. Files were mostly uploaded after class.
3. Some activities were done multiple times using different methods
4. All codes/functions written have been analyzed. I refrain from copying-and-pasting codes from the internet
5. I try to write a README file on each folder which explains the logic behind the code
6. Some exercises/code-alongs are not included
