# mgbaybay-kodego
Contains all activities from bootcamp

#### NOTES
1. Files were named according to the date/activity.
2. Files were mostly uploaded after class.
3. Some activities were done multiple times using different methods
4. All codes/functions written have been analyzed. I refrain from copying-and-pasting codes from the internet
5. I try to write a README file on each folder which explains the logic or process in writing the code
6. Only activities are included. Exercises/code alongs are not included

For questions and corrections, kindly dm me on discord (MG#8093). Thanks! :)
