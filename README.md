NOTES
1. Files are named according to the date/activity.
2. Files are mostly uploaded after class.
3. Some activities were done multiple times using different methods
4. All Codes/functions written have been studied. I refrain from doing copy-paste of codes from the internet
5. Each folder contains a separate README file which explains the process behind the activity
