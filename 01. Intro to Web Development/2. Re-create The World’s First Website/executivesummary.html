        <h1 style="color:brown; text-align:left;">WorldWideWeb - Summary</h1>
        <p style="color:black; text-align:left;">The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.</p>
        <p style="color:black; text-align:left;"> The project is based on the philosophy that much academic information should be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed teams, and the dissemination of information by support groups. Originally aimed at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted much interest in user support, resource discovery and collaborative work areas.

        <h2 style="color:green; text-align:left;">Reader View</h2>
        <p style="color:black; text-align:left;">The WWW world consists of documents, and links. Indexes are special documents which, rather than being read, may be searched. The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document containing links to the documents found. A simple protocol (" HTTP ") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword search by a remote information server.
        </p>
        <p style="color:black; text-align:left;">The web contains documents in many formats. Those documents which are hypertext, (real or virtual) contain links to other documents, or places within documents. All documents, whether real, virtual or indexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within the same addressing scheme.</p>
        <p style="color:black; text-align:left;">To follow a link, a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a number if he or she has no mouse). To search and index, a reader gives keywords (or other search criteria). These are the only operations necessary to access the entire world of data. </p>
